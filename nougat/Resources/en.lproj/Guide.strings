    <string>The gesture is split into 1/3rds and is shown by quickly flicking down from the Top of the Screen. Swipe down from the left 1/3rds to pull down the native Notification Center. Swipe down from the middle 1/3rds to show a row of Quick Toggles. Flick down from the Quick Toggles view to reveal the Main Toggle pane. A quick shortcut to the Main Toggles Pane is to swipe down from the right 1/3rds. In the Status Bar you can find a settings cog to take you quickly to the Settings app and an Arrow to Toggle between the Quick Toggle and Main View.
