TODO:
- Needs major overhaul with some more VCs (whole setup can be so much better)
- Add Oreo style
- "Remove" backdrop view when changing brightness like CC

Misc:
- Relook at prefs
- Long Hold / 3D Touch Gestures?
- Add More Toggle Options
- Finish StatusBar
- Is the full statusbar worth it?
- Review overall structure
- Improve performance
- Use constraints (NSLayoutConstraint/CompactConstraint)
